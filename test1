According to the wordcloud plot and table above, the most frequent words in positive tweets include: 'thanks', 'jetblue', 'southwestair','united', 'thank', 'flight','americanair', 'usairways', and 'great', 'service'. None of these words are the reason why they are satisfy with the flight.

## Negative Sentiment

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
negative <- negative %>%
  filter(!(word %in% list))
wordcloud(negative[,15],
          max.words = 100,
          random.order=FALSE, 
          rot.per=0.30, 
          use.r.layout=FALSE, 
          colors=brewer.pal(10, "Paired"))

negative1 <- negative %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  rename(freq = n)

head(negative1, 10)
```

According to the wordcloud plot and the table above, the most frequent words in negative tweets include: 'flight', 'united', 'usairways','americanair', 'not','no', 'southwestair', and 'but', 'cancelled'. Only cancelled is related to negative sentiment, so may be in the future we should filter more words in order to find out the reason why it is negative sentiment.

In addition, to find the reasons of negative feedback from customers further, we plot the distribution of the most frequent negative reasons in the data set.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = fct_infreq(factor(negativereason))))+
    geom_bar(fill='red')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+ ggtitle("Figure 3: Most Frequent Negative Reasons")  +  xlab("Negative Reasons")+ylab("Count")#sentiment distribution by airlines
```

According to figure 3, negative tweets are mostly caused by *Customer Service Issues*. Another major reason of complaints is *Late Flight*. The top negative reasons for each airline may be different from which for all major airlines. In addiction, we can't find out there is any correlation between the comment and the negative reason right now. Maybe it is because the data set is not large enough or there are no specific words for customer to express the reason why they don't like the airline service.

# Conclusion

In this project, we used twitter data to analyze the people's sentiments on the the major US Airlines. The opinions of people on the airlines were scraped from February of 2015. The method used in the project can also be applied for other sentiment analysis of products, services, companies and trending topics for the purpose of the research. In this project, the results show the distributions of customers' opinions expressed on twitter and reasons for negative, positive sentiments. The sentiments including positive, negative and neutral reflect the airline companies' customer satisfaction on their airlines. The reasons of expressing positive and negative tweets help the airline companies understand how to improve their services, such as avoiding late flight.

For future work, we can randomly select a larger data set of tweets in February 2015 for a more accurate understanding of customer satisfaction and better filter the positive/ negative sentiment to get a better result. Analyzing twitter sentiments by geographical location is another way to improve our understanding of the customer feedback expressed on Twitter.
